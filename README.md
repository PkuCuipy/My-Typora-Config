### About
This is my config file for Typora.app, including CSS themes (for all platforms) and keymaps (for Windows).

### Usage
1. Manually install required font as listed in `fonts` folder.
2. To ensure that the live, editing view is close to that of the exported pdf, one should config in Typora export settings:
    - Margin Top: 16mm
    - Margin Bottom: 16mm
    - Margin Left: 16mm
    - Margin Right: 16mm
    - font size: auto (DO NOT manually specify)
    - Width x Height: 313.7mm x 443.6mm

### Notice
- The above `Width` value 313.7 is obtained by binary searching on my machine.
- Should the exported PDF be quite different from what you see in Typora on your machine, try adjusting the `Width` parameter (while scaling `Height` in proportion) to tune it.
